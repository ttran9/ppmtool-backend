# Overview

- This is section 8 of [this course](https://www.udemy.com/full-stack-project-spring-boot-20-react-redux/)
    - I am making this repository as a back-up to this repository [here](https://github.com/ttran9/ExamplePPMTool).

- Since this is just for my own learning purposes I have decided to read the secret key (SECRET) in the SecurityConstants
file from an environment variable instead of just having it as a hard-coded public string.
    - I am still trying to figure out the most secure way to keep that private key string from being exposed to anyone
    else from the outside world and as I come across better solutions I will update the solution.
